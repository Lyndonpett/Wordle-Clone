# Wordle Clone

*Personal Project*

## Description
This project implements a design from scratch using plain HTML/CSS and JavaScript. It started as an interest in the Wordle game and wanting to combine it with learning, so the clone was spawned. 

The project does not have any restrictions.

## Project Advice
* Start with these strong foundations:
	-   reset CSS styling
	-   use variables
	-   simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
	-   avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
	-   simple HTML structure -  `div`  containers are your friend!
* Start from outside-in. Otherwise, it's easy to get lost in the HTML tags.

## Features
* Fully functioning website that takes into account accessibility and responsive design.
* Website is running on plain HTML/CSS and JavaScript, so no need to run any packages, just run a local server! (easily done with VS Code extensions)
## Download and try yourself
### 1. Clone the Repo
* Run the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lyndonpett/wordle-clone
```
### 2. Open the HTML
* Choose an HTML file to the corresponding task. Final design will be in index.html. In Visual Studio Code, use the ***"[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)"*** extension and the webpage will be open in your browser.

* If not using Visual Studio Code, choose whichever development local server you want to use. Then choose the HTML file you want to open.

### 3. View in Browser
* After the following steps, you should now be able to see the corresponding webpage open in your browser!
